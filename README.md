# WHO Ambient Air Quality Data Analysis (2024)

## Project Overview
This project analyses the **WHO Ambient Air Quality Database (2024)** using **Excel** for data cleaning and organisation and **Tableau** for visualisation and insights. The goal is to better understand air pollution levels worldwide, particularly focusing on **PM2.5 concentrations** in the UK.

## About the Dataset
The **WHO Ambient Air Quality Database** is a resource for data analysts working with **Excel and Tableau**. It contains extensive air quality measurements collected from different countries, enabling professionals to:
- Practise data cleaning techniques in Excel
- Explore trends using Tableau visualisations
- Interpret real-world environmental data for decision-making

### Importance of Air Pollution Analysis
The WHO reports that **99% of the world's population** is exposed to elevated levels of air pollution, posing severe health risks such as:
- **Heart diseases**
- **Lung diseases**
- **Strokes**
- **Cancer**

These impacts affect everyone, regardless of socio-economic status or location, and place a heavy burden on healthcare systems like the NHS.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
### Steps Taken in Excel:
1. **Imported the dataset** and checked for inconsistencies
2. **Handled missing values** by filtering out incomplete data
3. **Standardised country and city names** for consistency
4. **Formatted numerical values** to ensure accuracy in Tableau

## Data Visualisation in Tableau

### Key Visualisations Created:
üìå **Global PM2.5 Concentrations** - A world map displaying pollution levels across different regions
üìå **PM2.5 Levels by Country (Europe)** - A horizontal bar chart ranking European nations by air pollution levels
üìå **PM2.5 Levels by City (UK)** - A heatmap visualising the most affected cities in the UK

### Example Insights:
- **Countries with the highest PM2.5 levels** are primarily in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific Regions
- **European countries** with high pollution levels tend to be industrial and high-traffic zones
- **UK air quality** varies by region, with some cities exceeding WHO-recommended PM2.5 limits. Greater concentrations are located in the eastern and southern areas.

## Key Findings
üåç Air pollution is a **global issue** requiring international efforts to tackle.
üè≠ **Urban areas** and industrial hubs tend to have higher pollution levels.
‚ö†Ô∏è Some **UK cities exceed WHO PM2.5 limits**, necessitating further interventions.

---

## Recommendations
While individual actions like **sustainable transportation, consuming local produce, and using home air purifiers** can help, the primary responsibility lies with **local and national governments** to implement policies that target outdoor pollution sources.

The UK, in particular, still needs to continue its efforts in adopting and improving solutions to achieve its **air quality goals** of 10 ¬µg/m¬≥ of PM2.5 by 2040.

### Requirements:
- **Excel** (for data cleaning)
- **Tableau** (for visualisation)

### Steps to Explore the Data:
1. Open the Excel file to review cleaned datasets
2. Load the dataset into Tableau
3. Navigate through the dashboards to explore **global, European, and UK PM2.5 trends**
